# EthTools

EthTools is developed using the React Framework to provide a fast and usable experience to the end user. The goal is to provide a good interface for rapid prototyping, easier interaction with
smart contracts and an alternative for those moments where you don't have all the libraries
installed or you are in an emergency and don't have the time to remember all the commands

## Website

## Installing the app locally

Just clone the repo and run:

`npm install`

`npm start`

## Application Features

Currently, EthTools can do two things:

1- Explore contracts: It is very easy in EthTools to check a contract state, read its
variables and public functions, and commit state-changing actions to it.

2- Deploy contracts: Simply insert the contract code, choose constructor params,
and send the transaction to deploy new contracts to the Blockchain using MetaMask.
